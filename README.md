## Deployed Application

<!-- ![Going-Platinum-homepage]() -->


[Going-Platinum Heroku Deploy Link](https://going-platinum.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
Modern problems require modern solutions.  This is what we aim to achieve with our latest recreational app.  With time spent at home on the rise due to the covid pandemic, this is a wonderful app to use when working from home or enaging in recreational activities like excericse or gaming.  Going-Platinum allows users to create tasks such as sweeping the floors, time allocated for study, and working out with a randomly generated playlist from spotify based on Artist of choice and Duration.  


## Installation
There are many packages to install which can be viewed in the package.json.  please view it and remove any you deem unnecesary, then run the following command in your terminal.
```bash
npm i
```
Also keep in mind this application uses the Spotify web api which requires that you have and are signed into a Spotify premium account.  You can register for a free trial [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/?utm_source=us-en_brand_contextual_text&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_campaign=alwayson_ucanz_us_performancemarketing_premium_brand+contextual+text+exact+us-en+google&gclid=CjwKCAiAp4KCBhB6EiwAxRxbpLa76dHJ1ibPikfzrsUeMDz4vvc-oqTshXFELzmnUW0JUDLbtNzHXhoCoeEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.dshttps://cloudinary.com/home-2).

## Usage 

After Logging using firebase firebase which Going-Platinum uses for login and signup verification, the user is taken from the home page to the profile page.  The user then will sign in to their Spotify premium account by clicking on the Spotify login button.  After this sign in a token will be granted to the user which allows them to now create and play their playlists.  Fill out the form by specifying the task desired such as "doing laundry" and give the playlist a personal touch with a name.  Type in the name of the artist prefered and set the energy and duration and a random playlist of music with similar artists and genres will be generated.

## Test

Once the playlist is generated click the add to potify button to add the generated playlist to the your own Spotify account!  Going-Platinum allows the user to enchance their own Spotify experience by introducing them to new and familiar music while they work or play.  Of Course the playlists genreated from each individual task can be played within the app.  All that's left is to click the play playlist button to make the music player appear and click it's play, pause, next track, and previous track buttons.  Please note that a song will play only thirty seconds and not allow you to switch tracks unless you are signed in to a Spotify premium account.
